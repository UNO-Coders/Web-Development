Let's write our first template (file app/templates/index.html):

<html>
  <head>
    <title>{{ title }} - microblog</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <h1>Hello, {{ user.nickname }}!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
As you see above, we just wrote a mostly standard HTML page, with the only difference that there are some placeholders for the dynamic content enclosed in {{ ... }} sections.

Now let's see how we use this template from our view function (file app/views.py):

from flask import render_template
from app import app

@app.route('/')
@app.route('/index')
def index():
    user = {'nickname': 'Miguel'}  # fake user
    return render_template('index.html',
                           title='Home',
                           user=user)
Try the application at this point to see how the template works. Once you have the rendered page in your browser you may want to view the source HTML and compare it against the original template.

To render the template we had to import a new function from the Flask framework called render_template. This function takes a template filename and a variable list of template arguments and returns the rendered template, with all the arguments replaced.

Under the covers, the render_template function invokes the Jinja2 templating engine that is part of the Flask framework. Jinja2 substitutes {{...}} blocks with the corresponding values provided as template arguments.

Control statements in templates
The Jinja2 templates also support control statements, given inside {%...%} blocks. Let's add an if statement to our template (file app/templates/index.html):

<html>
  <head>
    {% if title %}
    <title>{{ title }} - microblog</title>
    {% else %}
    <title>Welcome to microblog</title>
    {% endif %}
  </head>
  <body>
      <h1>Hello, {{ user.nickname }}!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
Now our template is a bit smarter. If the view function forgets to define a page title then instead of showing an empty title the template will provide its own title. Feel free to remove the title argument in the render_template call of our view function to see how the conditional statement works.

Loops in templates
The logged in user in our microblog application will probably want to see recent posts from followed users in the home page, so let's see how we can do that.

To begin, we use our handy fake object trick to create some users and some posts to show (file app/views.py):

def index():
    user = {'nickname': 'Miguel'}  # fake user
    posts = [  # fake array of posts
        { 
            'author': {'nickname': 'John'}, 
            'body': 'Beautiful day in Portland!' 
        },
        { 
            'author': {'nickname': 'Susan'}, 
            'body': 'The Avengers movie was so cool!' 
        }
    ]
    return render_template("index.html",
                           title='Home',
                           user=user,
                           posts=posts)
To represent user posts we are using a list, where each element has author and body fields. When we get to implement a real database we will preserve these field names, so we can design and test our template using the fake objects without having to worry about updating it when we move to a database.

On the template side we have to solve a new problem. The list can have any number of elements, it will be up to the view function to decide how many posts need to be presented. The template cannot make any assumptions about the number of posts, so it needs to be prepared to render as many posts as the view sends.

So let's see how we do this using a for control structure (file app/templates/index.html):

<html>
  <head>
    {% if title %}
    <title>{{ title }} - microblog</title>
    {% else %}
    <title>Welcome to microblog</title>
    {% endif %}
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hi, {{ user.nickname }}!</h1>
    {% for post in posts %}
    <div><p>{{ post.author.nickname }} says: <b>{{ post.body }}</b></p></div>
    {% endfor %}
  </body>
</html>
Simple, right? Give it a try, and be sure to play with adding more content to the posts array.

Template inheritance
We have one more topic to cover before we close for the day.

Our microblog web application will need to have a navigation bar at the top of the page with a few links. Here you will get the link to edit your profile, to login, logout, etc.

We can add a navigation bar to our index.html template, but as our application grows we will be needing to implement more pages, and this navigation bar will have to be copied to all of them. Then you will have to keep all these identical copies of the navigation bar in sync, and that could become a lot of work if you have a lot of pages and templates.

Instead, we can use Jinja2's template inheritance feature, which allows us to move the parts of the page layout that are common to all templates and put them in a base template from which all other templates are derived.

So let's define a base template that includes the navigation bar and also the bit of title logic we implemented earlier (file app/templates/base.html):

<html>
  <head>
    {% if title %}
    <title>{{ title }} - microblog</title>
    {% else %}
    <title>Welcome to microblog</title>
    {% endif %}
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>Microblog: <a href="/index">Home</a></div>
    <hr>
    {% block content %}{% endblock %}
  </body>
</html>
In this template we use the block control statement to define the place where the derived templates can insert themselves. Blocks are given a unique name, and their content can be replaced or enhanced in derived templates.

And now what's left is to modify our index.html template to inherit from base.html (file app/templates/index.html):

{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block content %}
    <h1>Hi, {{ user.nickname }}!</h1>
    {% for post in posts %}
    <div><p>{{ post.author.nickname }} says: <b>{{ post.body }}</b></p></div>
    {% endfor %}
{% endblock %}
Since the base.html template will now take care of the general page structure we have removed those elements from this one and left only the content part. The extends block establishes the inheritance link between the two templates, so that Jinja2 knows that when it needs to render index.html it needs to include it inside base.html. The two templates have matching block statements with name content, and this is how Jinja2 knows how to combine the two into one. When we get to write new templates we will also create them as extensions to base.html.
